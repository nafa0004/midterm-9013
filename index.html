				Marrakech is possibly the most important of Morocco's four 
				former imperial cities (cities that were built by Moroccan Berber empires). 
				The region has been inhabited by Berber farmers since Neolithic times, 
				but the actual city was founded in 1062 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, 
				chieftain and cousin of Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin</p>
                <p>In the 12th century, the Almoravids built many madrasas (Koranic schools)
				and mosques in Marrakech that bear Andalusian influences.</p>
                <br>
				<p> 
				the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. 
				Despite the economic recession, 				
				Jemaa el-Fnaa is the busiest square in Africa</p>
                <p>After a period of decline, the city was surpassed by Fes, but in the early 16th century, 
				Marrakech again became the capital of the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The city regained its preeminence under wealthy Saadian sultans Abu Abdallah al-Qaim and Ahmad al-Mansur, 
				who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the El Badi Palace (1578)</p>

                <h2>Marrakech: Touristic</h2>
                <p>Like many Moroccan cities, Marrakech comprises an old fortified 
				city packed with vendors and their stalls (the medina), 
				bordered by modern neighborhoods, the most prominent of which is Gueliz.</p>
                <p>oday it is one of the busiest cities in Africa and serves as a 
				major economic centre and tourist destination.</p>
                
				<p>
				
				Marrakech grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, 
				religious, and trading centre for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa;Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch, Mohammed VI, with 
				
				real estate and hotel development in Marrakech has grown dramatically in the 21st century. </p>
                <br>
				
				<p>Marrakech is served by Ménara International Airport and the Marrakech railway station, 
				which connects the city to Casablanca and northern Morocco. 
				The red walls of the city, built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122–1123, and various buildings constructed in 
				red sandstone during this period, have given the city the nickname of the "Red City" 
				or "Ochre City".
				Marrakech has several universities and schools, including Cadi Ayyad University. (Source: Wikipedia)</p>
